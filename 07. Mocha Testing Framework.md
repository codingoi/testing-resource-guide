## Install Mocha I

A JavaScript project is a directory of files. The following command creates a file package.json that can be used to manage packages for the project.

```
$ npm init
```
After running this command you will be prompted to enter information about your project. It’s okay to skip some fields if you’re not ready to enter that information.

With your project setup, you can install packages.

```
$ npm install mocha -D
```

-D signifies that this package is a development dependency and will show up under the devDependecies section in package.json. This means that the package will only be included in development mode and will not be included in the production bundle.

After installing Mocha as a dependency we can run it in two ways.

The first (and more tedious) method is to call it directly from node_modules:

```
$ ./node_modules/mocha/bin/mocha
```
The second (and recommended) method is to add a script to package.json. In the scripts object in package.json, set the value of "test" to mocha. It should look like this:

```
"scripts": {
  "test": "mocha"
}
```

Now you can call Mocha with the following command:

```
$ npm test
```

## describe and it blocks

In Mocha we group tests using the describe function and define tests using the it function. These two functions can be used to make your test suite complete, maintainable, and expressive in the following ways:

Structure your test suite: you can organize tests into nested groups that reflect the structure of your implementation code.

Provide informative messages: you can define your tests using human-readable strings.

If you are testing a Math object with the method .max, you could use the following test code.

```
describe('Math', () => {
  describe('.max', () => {
    it('returns the argument with the highest value', () => {
      // Your test goes here
    });
    it('returns -Infinity when no arguments are provided', () => {
      // Your test goes here
    });
  });
});
```

## assert

To write the tests themselves, we can use the assert.ok method provided by Node.js.

In programming, a test compares an expected outcome to an actual outcome. For example, we expect the outcome of the following code…

```
const a = 1 + 2;
```
…to be: **a** has a value of 3. To test the value saved to a with plain JavaScript, you would need to write a conditional statement comparing a to the expected result. Inside the statement, you would construct an error when the actual outcome does not match the expected.

assert.ok() allows you to compare values and throw errors as needed using one function call. The small, human-readable format of the functions will help you make a more expressive test suite.

As a Node module, assert can be imported at the top of your files with

```
const assert = require('assert');
```
Both the describe and it functions accept two parameters: a descriptive string and a callback function. Though the functions are flexible, they are commonly used in the structure above: nest describe blocks to resemble the structure of your implementation code and write individual tests in it blocks. This makes your test suite isolated, maintainable, and expressive.

You call assert functions like this:

```
assert.ok(a === 3);
```
In this case a === 3 evaluates to true, so no error is thrown.

If an argument passed to assert.ok() evaluates to false, an AssertionError is thrown. The error communicates to Mocha that a test has failed, and Mocha logs the error message to the console.

```
const assert = require('assert');

describe('+', () => {
  it('returns the sum of its arguments', () => {
    // Write assertion here
    assert.ok(3 + 4 === 7);
  });
});
```

## Setup, Exercise, and Verify

The phases are defined as follows:

- Setup - create objects, variables, and set conditions that your test depends on

- Exercise - execute the functionality you are testing

- Verify - check your expectations against the result of the exercise phase. You can use the assert library here

Clear separation of each phase makes a test easier to read, change, and validate.


```
describe('.pop', () => {
  it('returns the last element in the array [3phase]', () => {
    // Setup
    const knightString = 'knight';
    const jediPath = ['padawan', knightString];

    // Exercise
    const popped = jediPath.pop();

    // Verify
    assert.ok(popped === knightString);
  });
});

```
