## Manual Testing

Software testing is the process of assessing the completeness and quality of computer software. Usually this is done by running a part of a system (like a web application) and comparing the actual behavior to the expected behavior.

One way to perform software testing is manual testing. Manual testing is a form of testing done by a human interacting with a system. With web apps, this might be clicking, dragging, and typing through a webpage. A list of actions and expected behaviors would be given. If the observed behavior doesnâ€™t match the expected behavior, the application has an error.

Errors, like the ones you may have found in the provided web app, are also called bugs. A bug is an error, fault, or flaw in software that makes a system behave in unexpected ways. As you read in the last exercise, these unexpected behaviors can cause harm to users. Ideally testing catches bugs before they are sent to users.
