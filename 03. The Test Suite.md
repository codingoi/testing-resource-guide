Tests are written with code, just like the rest of your web app. You can refer to the code defining your app as implementation code, and the code defining your tests as test code.

A collection of tests for a web application is called a test suite.

Test code is included with and structured similarly to implementation code. Often times changes to test code are associated with changes to implementation code and vice versa. Both are easier to maintain when they are stored in the same place.

- For example, if implementation code is written in index.js then the corresponding test code may be written in index-test.js.
