## Introduction

When developing and testing in JavaScript, we can use a testing framework called Jest. While there are many testing frameworks out there, Jest focuses on simplicity. Jest provides the two key ingredients needed for testing:

- An assertion library – an API of functions for validating a program’s functionality
- A test runner – a tool that executes tests and provides outputted test summaries

Unlike other testing frameworks which may require you to bundle these separately, Jest provides both, allowing us to begin testing right out of the box without much setup.


## Installing Jest

Before we can begin testing our code with Jest, the jest package must first be installed and configured. We will download Jest via the Node Package Manager (NPM) by running the following command in our terminal:

```
npm install jest --save-dev

```

The npm install jest command installs the jest node package and the --save-dev flag specifies to save it as a developer dependency. At this point, we should see "jest" included in the package.json file under "devDependencies":

```
"devDependencies": {
  "jest": "<version number>"
}
```

Now that we have Jest installed, let’s create a file to write our tests. The Jest API looks for files that are either inside of a **__tests__/** directory or any file that ends in either .test.js or .specs.js.

It is a good practice to match the name of the test file to the file that you are wanting to test. For example, if you were to test a file called **math.js**, you might create a file in the **__tests__/** directory called **math.test.js**.

Once you have your test files created, Jest provides a terminal command to run test files individually: **jest <filepath/filename>**. 

For example, to run the math.test.js test file we might write:

```
jest __tests__/math.test.js
```

We can also run tests on all of the files that have the .test.js or .spec.js extension or are within a **__tests__/** folder by simply running the jest command on its own:


## Configuring Jest

Though there are many command-line flags, one of the most commonly used is the **--coverage** flag:

```
jest __tests__/ --coverage
```

This --coverage flag allows us to get a report of which lines of our code were actually tested. In addition to being outputted in the terminal, this report becomes available in a directory named coverage/ that is created at runtime.

This report can help us make sure that our code has been thoroughly tested. From the report, we can see that there are four categories of our code that are being analyzed:

- **Statement** coverage analyzes the percentage of the program’s statements that have been executed.
- **Branch** coverage analyzes the percentage of the program’s edge cases that have executed.
- **Function** coverage analyzes the percent of the program’s functions that have been called during testing.
- **Line** coverage analyzes the percentage of the program’s executable lines in the source file that have been executed.

**each of those sections will show up at 0% coverage if you have not written any tests**

It is a good practice to preconfigure our test commands in our package.json file to allow us to run tests through npm with a simple terminal command.

To do this, we set up the "test" script in our package.json file’s "scripts" property:

```
"scripts": {
  // other scripts...
  "test": "jest __tests__/ --coverage"
}
```

We can now run tests on all of our Jest test files while also creating a coverage report by running this terminal command:

**npm test**

## Unit Testing with Jest (Part 1)

Now that Jest is installed and configured it is time to set up our first unit test. A unit test is designed to test the smallest unit of your code, like a single function.

When unit testing, each function should be tested in isolation. In Jest, we do this by creating separate containers for our testing logic using the test() function.

The test() function takes three arguments:

- A string describing what is being tested
- A callback function containing assertions and other testing logic
- An optional timeout in milliseconds that specifies how long a test should wait before automatically aborting. If unspecified, this defaults to 5000 ms.

```
//file: __tests__/recipes.test.js
 
// import the functions to test
import { findRecipe, getIngredients } from "./recipes.js"; 
 
test("Get the full recipe for Pesto", async () => {
    // testing logic for findRecipe() omitted...
}, 10000);
 
test("Get only the ingredients list for Pesto", () => {
    // testing logic for getIngredients() omitted...
});
```

Let’s look at the tests in this example.

- With the first argument of test(), we state the purpose of the test - to get the recipe for Pesto. This string shouldn’t explain the implementation of the function being tested, only the desired result.
- A callback function is passed as the second argument to test(). Inside is where we will write our testing logic. Since the function being tested makes an asynchronous API call, this callback is marked as async.
- Lastly, with the third argument, we specify that we want to see if this operation can be carried out in under 10000ms (10 seconds) since making the API call may take some time.
- The second test() follows the same pattern, however, the function being tested is not asynchronous so the async keyword is omitted from the callback function. Also, by leaving out the third argument, we are using the default 5000ms timeout.

Each time we create a new test() function call, we create a separate entry in our testing output when we run npm test. 

## Unit Testing with Jest (Part 2)

With our test() container set up, it is time to finish our first unit test by writing assertions to validate the various features of our code. To do this, Jest provides the expect() function.

The expect() function asserts how we expect our program to run and is used every time that we want to write a test. However, this function is rarely used alone – it can almost always be found in conjunction with matcher methods, like .toBe(), in the example below:

```
expect(2+2).toBe(4)
```

The value passed to expect() should be an expression that you want to test (2+2) while the matcher method determines how that expression will be validated and what the expected value of that expression is (.toBe(4)).

Remember, getIngredients() converts an object containing ingredients and their quantities for a recipe into an array of just the ingredients. To test this function, we can add testing logic to the callback passed to the test() function:

```
//file: __tests__/recipes.test.js
 
// import the function to test
import { getIngredients } from "./recipes.js"; 
 
test("Get only the ingredients list for Pesto", () => {
  //arrange
  const pestoRecipe = {
    'Basil': '2 cups',
    'Pine Nuts': '2 tablespoons',
    'Garlic': '2 cloves',
    'Olive Oil': '0.5 cups',
    'Grated Parmesan': '0.5 cups'
  }
  const expectedIngredients = ["Basil", "Pine Nuts", "Garlic", "Olive Oil", "Grated Parmesan"]
 
  //act
  const actualIngredients = getIngredients(pestoRecipe);
 
  //assertions
  expect(actualIngredients).toEqual(expectedIngredients)
});
```

In this example, we follow the Arrange, Act, Assert pattern in the callback passed to test():

- **Arrange**: We first declare the input (pestoRecipe) to be passed to the function being tested (getIngredients()) as well as the expected output (expectedIngredients).
- **Act**: We then pass the input variable into the function being tested and store the result in a new variable (actualIngredients).
- **Assert**: Finally, we use the expect() assertion function and the .toEqual() matcher to compare the values of the expected output with the actual output.

Multiple expect() assertions can be made within a single call to test(). Regardless of the number of assertions made within a unit test, in order for the entire test to pass, all assertions must pass.

**The .toBe() matcher can be used to compare simple data types for equality while the .toEqual() matcher is used to perform deep equality comparisons.**
