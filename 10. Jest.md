## Introduction

When developing and testing in JavaScript, we can use a testing framework called Jest. While there are many testing frameworks out there, Jest focuses on simplicity. Jest provides the two key ingredients needed for testing:

- An assertion library – an API of functions for validating a program’s functionality
- A test runner – a tool that executes tests and provides outputted test summaries

Unlike other testing frameworks which may require you to bundle these separately, Jest provides both, allowing us to begin testing right out of the box without much setup.


## Installing Jest

Before we can begin testing our code with Jest, the jest package must first be installed and configured. We will download Jest via the Node Package Manager (NPM) by running the following command in our terminal:

```
npm install jest --save-dev

```

The npm install jest command installs the jest node package and the --save-dev flag specifies to save it as a developer dependency. At this point, we should see "jest" included in the package.json file under "devDependencies":

```
"devDependencies": {
  "jest": "<version number>"
}
```

Now that we have Jest installed, let’s create a file to write our tests. The Jest API looks for files that are either inside of a **__tests__/** directory or any file that ends in either .test.js or .specs.js.

It is a good practice to match the name of the test file to the file that you are wanting to test. For example, if you were to test a file called **math.js**, you might create a file in the **__tests__/** directory called **math.test.js**.

Once you have your test files created, Jest provides a terminal command to run test files individually: **jest <filepath/filename>**. 

For example, to run the math.test.js test file we might write:

```
jest __tests__/math.test.js
```

We can also run tests on all of the files that have the .test.js or .spec.js extension or are within a **__tests__/** folder by simply running the jest command on its own:


## Configuring Jest

Though there are many command-line flags, one of the most commonly used is the **--coverage** flag:

```
jest __tests__/ --coverage
```

This --coverage flag allows us to get a report of which lines of our code were actually tested. In addition to being outputted in the terminal, this report becomes available in a directory named coverage/ that is created at runtime.

This report can help us make sure that our code has been thoroughly tested. From the report, we can see that there are four categories of our code that are being analyzed:

- **Statement** coverage analyzes the percentage of the program’s statements that have been executed.
- **Branch** coverage analyzes the percentage of the program’s edge cases that have executed.
- **Function** coverage analyzes the percent of the program’s functions that have been called during testing.
- **Line** coverage analyzes the percentage of the program’s executable lines in the source file that have been executed.

**each of those sections will show up at 0% coverage if you have not written any tests**

It is a good practice to preconfigure our test commands in our package.json file to allow us to run tests through npm with a simple terminal command.

To do this, we set up the "test" script in our package.json file’s "scripts" property:

```
"scripts": {
  // other scripts...
  "test": "jest __tests__/ --coverage"
}
```
